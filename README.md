**Deep Learning Challenges**

This repository contains the solutions and reports for two deep learning challenges assigned to students during the semester. 
In both challenges, participants were tasked with applying the deep learning models introduced in the course to solve specific problems. 
The main objectives of these challenges were to test the accuracy of the models on both a known dataset and an unknown one. 
Additionally, participants were required to provide explanations for their modeling choices and summarize the results obtained.
